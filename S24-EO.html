                My main reflections from this internship that I will bring into my future ambitions in interdisciplinary technical problem solving are:
                
                <br><br>1. Understanding cross-functional collaboration and integrated business systems and operations (government).
                <br>2. The value of human-centered, data-driven product design. 
                <br>3. Applying strategies for analyzing future risk preparedness.
                <br>4. Full-time office etiquette.
                <br>5. Microsoft products such as Excel as database management tools.  
                
                <br><br>In this report, I will reflect on my comprehensive experience, regarding my technical and cerebral professional development. Overall, I can successfully say I supported initiatives for improving Data and Social governance, learned a lot about enhancing electoral processes, as well as professionalism in the workplace.</a>

The specific computing domains covered are the intersection of Data Science, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and their application to the digital humanities (social sciences).

            <br><br>The coolest part working with Data and GIS specialists was learning about EO’s overall information infrastructure. Being able to see end-to-end, how the information flowed within the databases, and how that connected to other teams and processes enhanced my understanding of data governance as it relates to business objectives. As EO's clients are the voters and residents of Ontario, it is imperitive to create holistic business operations driven by human-centred product design. From back end database management, to accessible digital interfaces, to client relation management, and scalable infrastructure implementation, I can conceptualize the interconnectivity of various divisions.

            <a class="text-blue-700 text-sm font-bold uppercase pb-4">My future career</a>
            <a class="font-semibold hover:text-gray-800">EO is a midsized company with 1 office and 1 goal. Because of its intimate work structure and my contract requiring showing up 5 days a week, in-person, I was able to network a ton with employees in every division and on every level of authority from the other interns to the CEO.


            <a class="pb-6 height:100px">
                I had used GIS and DBMS tools in coursework which provided a good background for conceptualizing their broader applications to the organization. I specifically gained extensive experience processing Excel and VBA workbooks which is extremely useful as its appeal extends beyond every conceivable industry and position.

                <br><br>Although the prototypical career most Computer Science students seek is software development, I lean more towards the data management, analytics, and insights part of the product design lifecycle. This work term opened my eyes to the world of technology and its integration into specific business and operations.

                <br>
                <a class = "font-semibold hover:text-gray-800">Reflecting back, I was able to perform a variety of Data Governance concepts:</a>
                <li>Structuring consolidation of unstructured data,</li>
                <li>Quality validation, </li>
                <li>User acceptance testing (UAT), </li>
                <li>Trend-based analytics to inform decision making, </li>

            <a class="pb-6">
                <a class = "font-semibold hover:text-gray-800">There were many qualities exemplified by those surrounding me which I will take as a lesson for how to succeed in my career:</a>
                <li>My direct supervisor, Julia consistently demonstrated hard work, diligence, and patience within her responsibilities relating to the necessary attention to detail in data-oriented work.</li>
                <li>My internal team mentor, Rachel did the same summer student program in 2019 and now works full time for the company. She gave tons of good advice from the perspective of a young person navigating the transition from school to the workforce.</li>
                <li>My direct manager, Gabe taught me to be flexible and open to what life brings. Learning about his career path and the agility of transferring skills between diverse backgrounds and experiences echoed a common theme of being open-minded to new opportunities I heard this summer.</li>

                In one of my weekly mentor meetings with Rachel, who interviewed me for this position, I went over the performance objectives, and how I believed I exceeded the expectations. 

                <br>1. Knowledge of Elections Ontario as a government agency
                <br>2. Experiences with GIS and data visualization tools, relational databases and SQL, and other big data processing methodologies. 
                <br>3. Working well with others, cross-functionally, and managing multiple projects.

                    My team won this year’s intern project proposal presentation for risk management strategies to enhance disaster resiliency for EO and other EMB’s. We presented these findings and suggestions to management and executives who were looking for young and fresh ideas from youth in the province EO represents.
                    <br><br>Collaborating in a cross-functional team of interns from other divisions was a great learning experience for us to combine our unique skills and perspectives together. I knew about cybersecurity and technology trends, while my team members knew about law and environmental justice.
                    <br><br>While I cannot speak on specific insights within the internal strategy of the organization, the foresight and planning methods, tools, and frameworks my team developped can be expanded to create solutions in any industry!

                    <br>My involvement in the office Social Committee - connecting with other employees across the company.
                </a>
                Bringing my event planning skills from the RA job to life in a corporate setting was a great way to enhance my creativity, project management, and professional networking. It was in these initiative where I was praised for my attitude and work ethic by other employees I had not directly worked with. As an intern or co-op student, I believe it is important to bring a positive energy to the office as many older employees notice trends of enthusiatic work attitudes being less common among youth in my generation.
                <br><br>These 2 posters are examples of social events I helped facilitate. I helped strategize ideas and logistics, designed promotional posters, and specifically brought back physcial media in the form of polaroid photos (seen in next section below). Seeing people enjoy their time in the office, meeting each other, and hanging up the polaroid photos I took of them on their desk was incredibly fufilling. On my last day, while I was handing out ice cream, I had many employees tell me how much they would miss me and hoped to see me back soon.

                <a class="pb-6">
                    When I started in April, the Milton and Lambton-Kent-Middlesex by-elections were taking place. I wasn't able to contribute as I had just onboarded and I had hoped to see one during my term in the summer.
                    <br><br>
                    Fast-forward to the very last week, a snap by-election was called and seeing the development made everything I had learned about, real. At one point, I was on printer duty and seeing the physical list of electors for the riding was a transformative feeling. It was the feeling of knowing my impact of analyzing the quality of the elector registry list actually had real-world implications, knowing the work I did for the product, actually meant something.
